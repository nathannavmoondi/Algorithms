// search reviews quicker by providing real-time suggestions to search
// terms when the customer starts typing. When given a minimum of two characters into the search field the systerr
// will suggest at most three keywords from the review word repository. As the customer continues to type in the
// reviews search bar the relevant keyword suggestions will update automatically.

 

// Write an algorithm that will output a maximum of three keyword suggestions after each character is typed by the
// customer in the search field.

// If there are more than three acceptable keywords, return the keywords that are first in alphabetical order.
// Only return keyword suggestions after the customer has entered two characters.

// Keyword suggestions must start with the characters already typed

// Both the repository and the customerQuery should be compared in a case-insensitive way.

// Input

// The input to the method/function consists of two arguments:

// repository, a list of unique strings representing the various keywords from the Amazon review comment section;
// customerQuery, a string representing the full search query of the customer.

// Output

// Return a list of a list of strings in lower case, where each list represents the keyword suggestions made by the
// system as the customer types each character of the customerQuery. Assume the customer types characters in
// order without deleting or removing any characters. If an output is not possible, return an empty array ([]).

// Example

// Input:

// repository = [ "mobile", "mouse", "moneypot", "monitor", "mousepad" ]
// customerQuery = "mouse"

// Output:

// ["mobile", "moneypot", "monitor"]
// ["mouse", "mousepad"]

// ["mouse", "mousepad"]

// ["mouse", "mousepad"]

// Explanation:

// The chain of words that will generate in the search box will be

// mo, mou, mous, mouse

// and each line from output shows the suggestion of "mo", "mou", "mous", "mouse", respectively in each line.

// For the keyword suggestions made by the system that are generated for 'moâ€™, the matches that will be generated
// are:["mobile", "mouse", "moneypot", "monitor", "mousepad"]

// Alphabetically, they will be reordered to [ "mobile", "moneypot", "monitor", "mouse", "mousepad" ].

// Thus the keyword suggestions made by the system are [ "mobile", "moneypot", "monitor"].
